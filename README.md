# Create the Earth with React Three Fiber 
The literal world of 3D web development with React Three Fiber! In this project:

✨ Earth with realistic textures  
✨ Atmosphere glow using custom shaders  
✨ Shooting stars and a nebula background  
✨ Starfield (point cloud) with animations  

Props to https://threejs-journey.com/ for help with the Earth Shader!
